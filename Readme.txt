# Project Title
Portfolio Website


# Description
This is my Portfolio Website Project that I designed and developed based on the concepts of HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design. The project provides a view of my academic background, skills, projects and also a means to contact.  

It exhibits clean design, responsive designs, gradient, form validation and well structured code.

# Viewport Dimensions

The site is optimized according to the different screen sizes:

*Mobile (max-width: 640px)

Vertical stacking, bigger touch targets, full-width media.

Makes it smartphone-readable and usable.

*Tablet (641px – 1024px)

A little bigger font, better spacing, balanced content composition.

Supersized to fit in the middle-range.

*Desktop (min-width: 1025px)

Two column format: intro text + media next to each other.

Limited to 1100px maximum width to read.

Gives it a professional appearance on bigger screens.



# Color Scheme

My theme was Deep Navy and Blue Gradient and soft neutral backgrounds:

Background: #F1F6F8 (cream)

Text: #2B2B2B (ink/dark)

Accent Muted Text: #6B6B6B

Gradient Palette:

#110D4F

#0F0D4F

#1F1D57

#2C379C

#1F0D94

This generates a business, contemporary, and friendly appearance, not too heavy on reading, and striking accents.



# Gradients Used

Linear Gradient (Horizontal):

Used on header navigation bar (all pages).

Dark navy fades out to blue.

Angular Linear Gradient (135°):

used on buttons such as Send a Message.

Intent: brings out the CTAs, provides depth.
